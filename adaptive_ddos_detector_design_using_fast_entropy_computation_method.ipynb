        "Fast Entropy shows the significant reduce of computational time compared to conventional entropy computation while it maintains detection accuracy. However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. The paper introduces adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). \n",
